# Quantum Circuits - Bachelor thesis

This repository accompanies my bachelor thesis on **"Representation, calculation and simulation of quantum gates and simple quantum circuits "**.

## Contents

- Implementation and simulation of quantum gates with Qiskit
- Visualization of quantum registers
- Comparison of classical and quantum mechanical logic

## Structure

- `notebooks/`: interactive simulations with Jupyter (CNOT, Toffoli, etc.)
- `src/`: Python scripts for reuse and analysis
- `environment.yml`: Reproducible Conda environment

## Setup

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate quantensim
